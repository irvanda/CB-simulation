# CB-simulation
A simulation of backoff timer allocation. Given a number of nodes and the size of contention window size. We can determine the model of success and failure to get the probability of success and probability of failure of wireless radio transmission.

You can refer to the [conference proceeding](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7993934) for more detail explanation of this model.
